# Work Day Schedular

## Description

  This week's homework is to create a calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day. The webpage will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by **JQuery**.  As a user with busy schedule, I want to add important events to the daily planner so I can manage my time effectively.
